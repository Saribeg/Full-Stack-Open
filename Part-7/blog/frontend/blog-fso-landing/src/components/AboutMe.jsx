          Iâ€™m a JavaScript developer with 6 years of commercial experience in eCommerce, primarily
          working with Salesforce Commerce Cloud on large-scale international projects. Iâ€™ve
          delivered complex client- and server-side solutions across diverse domains.

          This full-stack blog project is part of my self-education â€“ a return to React and Node.js,
          which I first explored about 7 years ago at a tech school. Now, Iâ€™m actively integrating
          them into my professional stack â€“ and loving every minute of it.
