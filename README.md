# Full Stack Open â€“ Exercise Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to the [**Full Stack Open**](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course exercises. **Full Stack Open** is a free online web development course created by the University of Helsinki. I will be updating this repo as I progress through the course, part by part.

## Deployments
- Part 7: [**Blogs App**](https://fso-blog-app.vercel.app/) (Use for authentication Login: `harrypotter`, Password: `sekret`)
- Part 3: [**Phonebook**](https://phonebook-full-stack-open-gkc1.onrender.com)

## Repository Structure

Each part of the course has its own subdirectory in this repository: Part-1, Part-2, etc.
Each folder contains the exercise solutions and projects for that part of the course, matching the official Full Stack Open curriculum structure.

## Progress Tracking

All exercises and progress are tracked using a GitHub **Projects** board on this repository. The project board is used to manage tasks for each exercise and generally monitor my progress throughout the course. This helps simulate an agile workflow for completing the course exercises.

## Development Workflow

To simulate a professional development workflow, all code goes into the `main` branch via Pull Requests. I do **not** commit directly to the main branch. Instead, for each exercise or feature, a dedicated feature branch is created and worked on. Once the solution is ready, it is merged into `main` through a PR (pull request), allowing for code review and maintaining a clean Git history.

## Naming Conventions

For consistency, the following naming conventions are followed in this project:

### Branches

```
part-0/task-0.4-new-note-diagram
```

### Commit messages

```
part-0/task-0.4: add: new note diagram
```

### Pull Request titles

```
Part-0/Task-0.4: Add Mermaid sequence diagram for new note creation
```

This naming scheme makes it easy to see which part and exercise a commit or branch relates to, and it mirrors a real-world workflow where feature branches and PRs correspond to specific tasks or issue tickets.

## Project Status

**Work in Progress:** This project is an ongoing effort. All parts are being solved and added gradually. The repository will continue to be updated as I complete more exercises.
